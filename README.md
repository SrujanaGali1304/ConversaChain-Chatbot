# ConversaChain-Chatbot

I created a chatbot that can engage in natural conversations using Flowise AI and LangChain. Flowise AI is a GUI that makes it easy to build chatbots without having to code. LangChain is an open-source framework that allows you to create chatbots that are powered by large language models. The chatbot is hosted on a website that I built using HTML. The chatbot is able to hold conversations and provide information on a variety of topics. I have tested the chatbot with a variety of users and received a positive feedback.
